{"title":"Lectures of Linear Algebra","markdown":{"headingText":"Lectures of Linear Algebra","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"<font color='purple' size=2.5><i>Updated on Aug 2024</i></font>\n![Presentation1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59842360/159695863-678be5bc-d146-4340-9592-003ad93241e1.jpg)\n\nThese lecture notes are intended for introductory linear algebra courses, suitable for university students, programmers, data analysts, algorithmic traders and etc. \n\nThe lectures notes are loosely based on several textbooks:\n\n1. <b><i>Linear Algebra and Its Applications</i></b> by Gilbert Strang \n2. <b><i>Linear Algebra and Its Applications</i></b> by David Lay \n3. <b><i>Introduction to Linear Algebra With Applications</i></b> by DeFranza & Gagliardi\n4. <b><i>Linear Algebra With Applications</i></b> by Gareth Williams\n\n![cover-min](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59842360/83939172-64df6c00-a7e3-11ea-80b1-058af696d5a3.png)\n\nHowever, the crux of the course is not about proving theorems, but to demonstrate the practices and visualization of the concepts. Thus we will not engage in precise deduction or notation, rather we aim to clarify the elusive concepts and thanks to Python/MATLAB, the task is much easier now.\n\n## Prerequisites\nThough the lectures are for beginners, it is beneficial that attendants had certain amount of exposure to linear algebra and calculus.\n\nAnd also the attendee are expected to have basic knowledge (3 days training would be enough) of \n- [x] Python\n- [x] NumPy\n- [x] Matplotlib\n- [x] SymPy\n\nAll the codes are written in an <b>intuitive manner</b> rather than efficient or professional coding style, therefore the codes are exceedingly straightforward, I presume barely anyone would have difficulty in understanding the codes.\n\nThe notes were written in JupyterLab, the interative plot requires ```ipympl```. To install, type in ```conda install -c conda-forge ipympl``` if you have JupyterLab 3.x. Check <a href='https://github.com/matplotlib/ipympl'><code>ipympl</code>page</a> for more details.\n\n## Environment Setup\nI use poetry to management environment, if you happen to use VS code like me, please follow the steps below:\n1. In Windows powershell and install poetry ``` (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | python -p```\n2. Navigate to ```cd $env:APPDATA\\Python\\Scripts```, check if poetry being installed.\n3. Open a notepad ```notepad $profile``` and set alias for poetry ```Set-Alias poetry \"C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Roaming\\Python\\Scripts\\poetry.exe\"``` in notepad, I prefered this way, because sometimes setting env path not working in windows.\n4. Reload profile by ```. $profile```.\n5. If you are on your personal computer ```Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser``` to unstrict your execution policy and choose Y.\n6. Resume the default restricted policy for security ```Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Scope CurrentUser```.\n7. Now check ```poetry --version```, if you see the version printed, good to go.\n8. You choose to use ```poetry update```, or just manage version at your own convenience.\n\n## What to Expect from Notes\nThese notes will equip you with most needed and basic knowledge for other subjects, such as Data Science, Econometrics, Mathematical Statistics, Financial Engineering, Control Theory and etc., which heavily rely on linear algebra. Please go through the tutorial patiently, you will certainly have a better grasp of the fundamental concepts of linear algebera. Then further step is to study the special matrices and their application with your domain knowledge.  \n\n## Contents\n\n[Chapter 1 - Linear Equation
